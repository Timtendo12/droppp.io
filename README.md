This code was found on their website. It doen't work as you need to recreate their package.json. All package.jsons are gone from root and /node-modules/ but if you really want to you could recreate it by going through all node modules but im too tired for that.

AFAIK it does not include any sensitive information other than the API routes that the site uses.
